rem | This script is meant to be used by the FILTER_PATTERNS setting
rem | in a Doxyfile, because FILTER_PATTERNS does not allow parameters.
rem | Alternatively it can be used by the INPUT_FILTER option.
rem |
rem | Using INPUT_FILTER option:
rem |   Set options in your Doxyfile as follows:
rem |      INPUT_FILTER           = \path\to\make.bat
rem |
rem | Using FILTER_PATTERNS option:
rem |   Set options in your Doxyfile as follows:
rem |      INPUT_FILTER           = 
rem |      FILTER_PATTERNS        = *.vb=\path\to\make.bat
